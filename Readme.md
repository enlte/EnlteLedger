A decentralized blockchain based system to solve real life problems without going through a centralised government or an organisation. A location based social engine creating an adjustable small world phenomenon with faster and better networking capabilities. It aims to  give power to the people by giving them power to rate any experience using their identity or anonymously and broadcasting it to the network with sending real-time updates to people nearby and leaving geo-stamp along with geofencing the experience. Negative experiences are broadcasted to nearby nodes real time and giving them opportunity to nearby nodes to earn enlte coins by helping them and for the broadcasting node to spread awareness and standing up against it.
