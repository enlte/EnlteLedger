We propose a location-based small world social internet with the characteristics of providing more
intelligent queries, connections and better results. Giving one universal identity of user with power of
being anonymous. Using the power to rating an experience to develop a database of a universal
reputation system based on blockchain with hierarchy of Maple Roots. Giving an opportunity to the users
to rate their experiences, problems and broadcast it to the people nearby as well as geostamp &
geo-fencing it forever. Other users, organisations can help resolve the issue or bad experience or we will
be able to spread awareness to help other people from similar experience. Decentralising the power to
the people by motivating users to help each other and spread awareness and earn enlte tokens in
exchange of that.
